## About
**dev-scritps** is a set of useful tunings for Linux user's profile, terminal, vim, git. It also includes some common scripts, 
commands and shortcuts I found useful for every-day routine. 

It is not a Definitive Guide or absolute truth of Configuration of All the Stuff, but snippets I apply for every Linux installation, 
shortcuts which I use every day, scripts that I reimplemented a dozens of times (so they eventually became something common and settled here).
I think that is why it is valuable: you don't have to learn all possible commands/options, but acquire something useful, and time-proven.

Any suggestions, PRs and comments are really welcome.
